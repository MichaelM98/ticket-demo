<br/>
The end-user initiates the process by creating a new ticket in the osTicket system. In this example, Michael Muniz reports an issue accessing work email on a mobile device, selecting the "Report a Problem" help topic. The ticket includes a detailed issue summary to help the help desk team diagnose the problem efficiently.

<br/>
After submission, the ticket is assigned to Jane Doe, the help desk agent. Jane initiates communication with Michael by asking for additional details about the issue. Michael responds, providing crucial information, such as using the Gmail app on an iPhone 14 Pro. This stage demonstrates the importance of clear communication in understanding and resolving the issue.

#### **3. Working the Issue**

To address the problem, Jane provides troubleshooting steps, including verifying credentials, checking the internet connection, and re-adding the email account. Michael confirms that re-adding the account resolves the issue, successfully restoring his access to work email. This step highlights a structured approach to troubleshooting and problem-solving.

#### **4. Resolution**

With the issue resolved, the ticket is marked as closed. Jane documents the resolution with a note stating, "Michael confirmed the issue was fixed after following Step 4." Proper documentation ensures that the process is recorded for future reference and accountability.
